# Chaotic-System---Non-Linear-Time-Series-Analysis

The analysis of time series data plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying dynamics and patterns of various systems. Time series data refers to a sequence of observations recorded at regular intervals over a specific period. Traditionally, linear methods have been widely employed to analyze time series data. However, in many real-world applications, the dynamics of the underlying systems are often nonlinear, making linear analysis techniques insufficient.
The purpose of this analysis is to delve into the realm of nonlinear time series analysis and explore the characteristics and behaviors of a given time series. By employing advanced techniques specifically designed for nonlinear systems and the corresponding packages in R language, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, assess the system's complexity, and make predictions based on the observed data.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:
1. Calculate the time delay required for properly embedding the corresponding system attractor.
2. Estimate the minimum embedding dimension and fractal dimension of the system.
3. Determine the local Lyapunov spectrum and compute the Lyapunov exponents.
4. Calculate the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy to measure the complexity of the system.
5. Utilize nonlinear time series forecasting methods to predict the future values of the time series and assess the prediction error.
6. Visualize the system's phase space and construct a phase portrait to gain insights into its dynamics.
